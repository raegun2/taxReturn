Where you require more detailed information, access may not be so straightforward and so we may charge you a reasonable access charge to compensate us for the time and costs associated with locating, collating and providing the information that you request. Where we seek to charge you with an access fee, we will estimate those costs up front and give you the opportunity for us to proceed (including out of pocket expenses such as photocopying costs). These fees are subject to change at our absolute discretion and we bear no requirement to provide you with notice to changes in these fees.</li>
